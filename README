com.sif.reverse.ReverseFileLineReader provides functionality for reading a file line by line starting from the end of the file (and moving toward the start of the file).

To build simply download and install Apache Ant (http://ant.apache.org/) then run "ant" in the root directory.

The newly built reverse.jar will reside at dist/lib/reverse.jar.
